`@script`
To ensure that a function works as expected, it is not enough to test the function for just one input.

## Which inputs to test?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "be4746fc7b"
```

`@part1`
```python
def divides(denominator, numerator):
    if numerator / denominator == 0:
        return True
    return False
```

| Input | Expected return value | Function returns | Confidence |
|----------|--------|--------|-----|
| `(2, 6)` | `True` | `True` | Low |


`@script`
You need to test the function for a list of inputs. In general, the more inputs you check, the more confident you can be that the function doesnâ€™t have bugs.
